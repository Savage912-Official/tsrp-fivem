# Administration Resource
Tools for performing various administrative functions on or in the server.

The following list of commands work in-game for [permissioned](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/server-commands/#access-control-commands) players. Commands that don't require specific game knowledge (i.e. a spawn location) also work from a server console.
- `/createo <model name>` - spawn an object from a particular model.
- `/goto <x> <y> <z>` - teleport to specific map coordinates.
- `/join <player ID>` - teleport to a specific player.
