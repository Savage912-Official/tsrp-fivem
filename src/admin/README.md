# Administration Resource
Tools for performing various administrative functions on or in the server.

The following list of commands work in-game for [permissioned](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/server-commands/#access-control-commands) players. Most "normal" admin functions are provided via the [txAdmin panel](https://txadm.in/). These are things which txAdmin doesn't handle. Commands that don't require specific game knowledge (i.e. a spawn location) also work from a server console.

- `/createo <model name>` - spawn an object from a particular model.
- `/giveweapon <player ID> <name>` - give a player a specific weapon.
- `/goto <x> <y> <z>` - teleport to specific map coordinates.
- `/join <player ID>` - teleport to a specific player.
- `/playanim <dictionary> <animation>` - play a specific animation.
- `/setammo <player ID> <weapon> <amount>` - give a player ammo for a weapon.
